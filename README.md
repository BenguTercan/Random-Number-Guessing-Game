# Random-Number-Guessing-Game
This is a number guessing game that works with Client-Server logic in Java language. The client program sends the number value from the user to the server. The statement of higher/lower/true are sent to the Client by comparing the received data with the randomly generated value (between 1 and 10) on the server. User can make 3 guesses. The program stops when the guess is correct. If the third guess is wrong, the correct number is printed with the word which is "wrong" and the program stops. The server program waits for any client connection to be established with the accept () method.
